Project structure

- `index.html` — Main page
- `assets/css/styles.css` — Compiled stylesheet
- `assets/scss/` — Source SCSS (partials grouped by purpose)
- `assets/js/main.js` — Small interactive bits
- `assets/img/` — Images used by the page (including `preview.png`)

Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS (Sass)
- Vanilla JavaScript

How to customize

1. Edit SCSS source files in `assets/scss/` and recompile to `assets/css/styles.css` (e.g., using the Sass CLI).
2. Replace images in `assets/img/`.
3. Tweak markup in `index.html` and scripts in `assets/js/main.js`.

Accessibility & performance notes

- Uses semantic tags (header, main, footer) for better accessibility.
- Images are already optimized but can be further compressed for faster load.
